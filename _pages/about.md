I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at <a href="https://www.fss.ulaval.ca/economique" target="_blank">Laval University</a>. My area of research involves micro-econometrics, labor economics, development economics and public economics.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I use  both experimental and non-experimental methods to address
questions relating to taxation, welfare, productivity and human capital to help in the design
and implementation of effective economic policies.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I also work on national representative household surveys to address poverty and inequality questions in developing countries.
